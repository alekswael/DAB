QUESTIONS FOR ROSS:
Will i be evaluated on my code?
How important is commented code?
How important is congruency in code style? Sometimes objects, sometimes procedural
Much of the main evaluation code is copied from the TAB repo - is this a problem? Should i rewrite it further?
I use an open source model, but run it through Google's API.
